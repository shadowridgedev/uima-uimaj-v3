  <title>Migration aids</title>
    
    <para>To aid migration, some features of UIMA V3 which might cause migration difficulties 
      can be disabled.  Users may initially want to disable these, and get their pipelines working,
      and then over time, re-enable these while fixing any issues that may come up, one feature
      at a time.
    </para> 
    
    <para>
      Global JVM properties for UIMA V3 that control these are described in the table below.  
    </para>

                  <para>Default: equal Type Systems are consolidated.</para>
                  <para>When type systems are committed, the resulting Type System (Java object) 
                    is considered read-only, and is compared to already existing Type Systems.
                    Existing type systems, if found, are reused.  Besides saving storage, this can
                    sometimes improve locality of reference, and therefore, performance. 
                    Setting this property disables this consolidation.</para></entry>

                  <para>Default: normally created Feature Structures are not kept in a map.</para>
                  <para>In version 3, normally, Feature Structures are not added to the 
                        map used by the Low Level CAS API to map from int ids to Feature Structures.
                        This has the benefit that no longer referenced Feature Structures may be 
                        garbaged collected.  This behavior may be overridden by this property.</para></entry>
