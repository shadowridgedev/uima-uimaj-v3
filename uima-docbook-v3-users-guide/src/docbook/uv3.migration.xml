  <title>Migrating from Version 2 to 3</title>
  <titleabbrev>Migrating</titleabbrev>
  
  <para>To migrate a UIMA application / pipeline to version 3, you need to replace the Version 2 JCas
	  classes with version 3 classes.  This is best done by running the migration tool, which is available
	  as a stand-alone command line tool (<code>runV3migrateJCas.sh or ...bat</code>), or 
	  as an Eclipse launch configuration.</para>
	  
	<para>Run this tool using a Java 8 JDK (as opposed to a Java JRE) in order to have the Java compiler available.</para>

  <para>The results of the migration include the migrated class files and a set of logs, summarized in the console
    output, detailing anything that might need inspection to verify the migration was done correctly.
  </para>
  
  <blockquote><para>
    If all is OK, the migration will say that it "finished with no unusual conditions", at the end.
  </para></blockquote> 	  

  <para>To complete the migration, do any packaging you wish to the converted JCas files
    and update your UIMA application to use these classes in place of the version 2 JCas classes.
  </para>
    
  <para>The migration tool is able to scan multiple directory trees, looking for existing Java
	  source (.java) or class (.class) files, even inside Jars and PEAR archives. If compiled class files
	  are used as input, a Java decompiler is used to decompile these to source.
	  For PEARs and Jars, it replaces the migrated and compiled classes in copies of the PEARs and Jars.
	</para>
	
	<para>  
	  The actual migration step is a source-to-source transformation, done using a Java parse of the source files.
	  The parts in the source which are version 2 specific with the equivalent
	  version 3 code.
	  Only those parts which need updating are modified;
    other code and comments which are part of the source file are left unchanged.  
    Detailed reports detailing any issues encountered are written to log files. 
  </para>
    
<!--    <section id="uv3.migration.automatic">
    <title>Automatic migration</title>
    
    <para>It is sometimes possible to have this migration done automatically, when a pipeline is started up.  Although
      convenient, it has some drawbacks, the main ones being that it may not work correctly for more complex
      customized JCas sources, and it slows down the launch of pipelines.  Ideally, the migration utility would be used
      and the results checked before proceeding, and the migrated classes replaced in the pipeline(s), as a one time
      migration process.</para>
      
    <para>The automatic migration works by detecting version 2 classes, decompiling them, migrating them, compiling
      the migrated version, and then loading them in place of the version 2 classes.</para>
    
    <para>The automatic migration will throw a Runtime Exception 
    if an unusual condition occurs for any reason during this process.
    </para>
  </section>
 --> 
 		 
		 <note><para>The compilation step (done after the source-to-source transformation) requires that a Java compiler is available 
		   (which is the case if you're running with a Java JDK, not a JRE).
		 </para></note>
		 
		 <note><para>After running the tool, it is important to confirm that the migration completed without any unusual conditions, by
		   examining the console output and logs.

	    <title>Running the migration tool</title>
	    <para>The tool can be run as a stand-alone command, using the launcher scripts <code>runV3migrateJCas</code>; 
	      there are two versions of this &mdash; one for windows (ending it ".bat") and one for linux / mac (ending in ".sh").
		    If you run this without any arguments, it will show a brief help for the arguments.
		  </para>
		  
		  <para>There is also an Eclipse launch configuration, which is available if you have the uimaj-examples project
		    in your Eclipse workspace.  This is used by selecting a project whose class path is the one needed by the
		    JCas definitions to be migrated, and then launching "UIMA run V3 migrate JCas from classes roots" and following
		    the two prompts - one to enter a directory which is the root directory of the JCas classes to be converted, and 
		    another directory to use as the output directory; these two inputs are "prompted" for by this Eclipse launcher.
		  </para>
	    
	    <para>No matter how the tool is started, the input to the tool is one or more directory tree roots; 
	      the tool will scan the file system under these roots (including inside Jars and PEARs), 
	      looking for definitions to migrate.

	      <para>Sometimes, a classpath or directory tree may contain multiple instances of the same JCas class.
	        These might be identical, or they might be different versions.  The migration utility detects this, 
	        and migrates all non-identical instances, using a convention to store them in the output directory in a manner
	        where different versions can be conveniently compared using tooling such as Eclipse's file compare.
