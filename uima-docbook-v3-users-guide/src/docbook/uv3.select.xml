<chapter id="uv3.select">
  <title>The select framework for working with CAS data</title>
  <titleabbrev>Select framework</titleabbrev>
  
  <para>The <emphasis>select</emphasis> framework provides a concise way to work with
  Feature Structure data stored in the CAS. It is integrated with the Java 8 <emphasis>stream</emphasis>
  framework, and provides additional capabilities supported by the underlying 
  UIMA framework, including the ability to move both forwards and backwards while iterating,
  moving to specific positions, and doing various kinds of specialized Annotation 
  selection such as working with Annotations spanned by another annotation (think of a Paragraph
  annotation, and the Sentences or Tokens within that).
  </para>
  
  <para>There are 3 main parts to this framework:</para>
  
  <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
    <listitem>
      <para>The source
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>what to select, ordering
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>what to do
      </para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  
  <figure id="uv3.select.big_picture">
          <title>Select - the big picture</title>
          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>
              <imagedata width="5.7in" format="PNG" fileref="&imgroot;select_big_pic.png"/>
            </imageobject>
            <textobject><phrase>Select composed of sources, what to select, and what to do</phrase>
            </textobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure>
  
  <para>These are described in code using a builder pattern to specify the many options and parameters.
  Some of the very common parameters are also available as positional arguments in some contexts.
  Most of the variations are defaulted so that in the common use cases, they may be omitted.
  </para>
  
  <section id="uv3.select.builder_pattern">
    <title>Select&apos;s use of the builder pattern</title>
    
    <para>The various options and specifications are specified using the builder pattern.
    Each specification has a name, which is a Java method name, sometimes having further parameters.
    These methods return an instance of SelectFSs; this instance is updated by each builder method.
    </para>
    
    <para>A common approach is to chain these methods together.  When this is done, each subsequent method
    updates the SelectFSs instance.  This means that the last method in case there are 
    multiple method calls specifying the same specification is the one that is used.
    </para>
    
    <para>For example,
    <programlisting>a_cas.select().typePriority(true).typePriority(false).typePriority(true)</programlisting>
    would configure the select to be using typePriority (described later).</para>
    
    <para>Some parameters are specified as positional parameters, for example, a UIMA Type, or a starting position or
    shift-offset.</para>
  </section>
  
  <section id="uv3.select.sources">
    <title>Sources of Feature Structures</title>
    
    <para>Feature Structures are kept in the CAS, and may be accessed using UIMA Indexes.
    Note that not all Feature Structures in the CAS are in the UIMA indexes; only those that the 
    user had "added to the indexes" are. Feature Structures not in the indexes are not 
    included when using the CAS as the source for the select framework.</para>
    
    <para>  
    Feature Structures may, additionally, be kept in <code>FSArrays</code> and <code>FSLists</code>.
    All three of these sources may be used with <code>select</code>.</para>
    
    <para>For CAS sources, if Views are being used, there is a separate set of indexes per CAS view.
    When there are multiple views, only one view's set of indexed Feature Structures is accessed - the
    view implied by the CAS being used.  Note that there is a way to specify aggregating over all views; see
    <code>allViews</code> described later.</para>
    
    <para>Users may specify all Feature Structures in a view, or restrict this in two ways:
    <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
      <listitem>
        <para>specifying an index: Users may define their own indexes, in additional to the built in ones, and 
        then specify which index to use.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>specifying a type: Only Feature Structures of this type (or its subtypes) are included.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    
    <para>It is possible to specify both of these, using the form <code>myIndex.select(myType)</code>; 
        in that case the type must be the type or a subtype of
        the index's top most type.
    </para>
        
    <para>If no index is specified, the default is 
    <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
      <listitem>
        <para>to use all Feature Structures in a CAS View, or</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>to use all Feature Structures in the view&apos;s AnnotationIndex,
        if the selection and ordering specifications require an AnnotationIndex.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist></para>
    
    <para>Note that the FSArray and FSList sources are considered ordered, but non-sorted, 
          and therefore cannot be used for an operations which require a sorted order.</para>
      
    <para>There are 4 sources of Feature Structures supported:</para>

    <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
	    <listitem>
	      <para>a CAS view: all the FSs that were added to the indexes for this view.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>an Index over a CAS view. Note that the AnnotationIndex is often implied by other 
	            <code>select</code> specifications, so it is often not necessary to supply this.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Feature Structures in a UIMA FSArray instance
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Feature Structures in a UIMA FSList
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>
	  
	  <para>Each of these sources has a new API method, <code>select(...)</code>, which initiates the select specification.
	  The select method can take an optional parameter, specifying the UIMA type to return.
	  If supplied, the type must must be the type or subtype of the index 
	  (if one is specified or implied); it serves to further restrict the types selected beyond whatever the 
	  index (if specified) has as its top-most type.</para>

	      </textobject>
	    </mediaobject>
	  </figure>
	  
	  <para>A UIMA index is the usual source.  
	  If a CAS is used, all Feature Structures that were added to the index in the
	  specified CAS view are used as the source.  The FSArray and FSList sources have more limited configurability,
	  because they are considered non-sorted, 
	  and therefore cannot be used for an operations which require a sorted order, such as
	  the various bounding selections (e.g. <code>coveredBy</code>) 
	  or positioning operations (e.g. <code>startAt</code>).</para>
	  
	  <para>
	  The optional type argument for <code>select(...)</code> specifies a UIMA type.  This restricts the Feature Structures
	  to just those of the specified type or any of its subtypes.  If omitted, if an index is used as a source, 
	  its type specification is used; otherwise all types are included.</para>
	  
	  <para>Type specifications may be specified in multiple ways.  
	  The best practice, if you have a JCas cover class
	  defined for the type, is to use the form <code>MyJCasClass.class</code>.  This has the advantage of setting the 
	  expected generic type of the select to that Java type.
	  </para>
	  
	  <para>The type may also be specified by using the actual UIMA type instance (useful if not using the 
	  JCas), using a fully qualified type name as a string, or using the JCas class static <code>type</code> field.</para>
  
  <section id="uv3.select.sources.generics">
    <title>Sources and generic typing</title>
    <para>The select method results in a generically typed object, which is used to have subsequent operations
    make use of the generic type, which may reduce the need for casting.</para>
    
    <para>The generic type can come from arguments or from where a value is being assigned, 
    if that target has a generic type.  This latter source is only partially available in Java, as it does not
    propagate past the first object in a chain of calls; this becomes a problem when using <code>select</code> with
    generically typed index variables.
    </para>
    
    <para>There is also a static version of the <code>select</code> method which takes a 
    generically typed index as an argument.</para>
    <informalexample>  <?dbfo keep-together="always"?>  
    <programlisting>// this works
// the generic type for Token is passed as an argument to select
FSIterator&lt;Token&gt; token_it = cas.select(Token.class).fsIterator();

FSIndex&lt;Token&gt; token_index = ... ; // generically typed

// this next fails because the
// Token generic type from the index variable being assigned
// doesn't get passed to the select().
FSIterator&lt;Token&gt; token_iterator = token_index.select().fsIterator();

// You can overcome this in two ways:
// pass in the type as an argument to select
// using the JCas cover type.  
FSIterator&lt;Token&gt; token_iterator = 
    token_index.select(Token.class).fsIterator();

// You can also use the static form of select
// to avoid repeating the type information
FSIterator&lt;Token&gt; token_iterator = 
    SelectFSs.select(token_index).fsIterator();

// Finally, you can also explicitly set the generic type 
// that select() should use, like a special kind of type cast, like this:
FSIterator&lt;Token&gt; token_iterator =
    token_index.&lt;Token&gt;select().fsIterator();
</programlisting>
</informalexample>
        
    <para>Note: the static <code>select</code> method may be statically imported into code that uses it, to avoid repeatedly 
    qualifying this with its class, <code>SelectFSs</code>.</para>
    
  <para>Any specification of an index may be further restricted to just a subType (including that
  subtype&apos;s subtypes, if any) of that index&apos;s type.
  For example, an AnnotationIndex may be specialized to just Sentences (and their subtypes):
  <programlisting>FSIterator&lt;Token&gt; token_iterator = 
    annotation_index.select(Token.class).fsIterator();
</programlisting>
  </para>

  <section id="uv3.select.selection_and_ordering">
    <title>Selection and Ordering</title>
    
    <para>There are four sets of sub-selection and ordering specifications, grouped 
    by what they apply to:

	    other (non-default) value.</para>
	    
	    <para>For example, normally, when working with bounded limits within Annotation Indexes, type
	    priorities are ignored when computing the bound positions.  
	    Specifying typePriority() says to use type priorities.</para>
	    
	    <para>Additionally, the boolean configuration methods have an optional form where they take a boolean value; 
	    true sets the property.  
	    So, for example typePriority(true) is equivalent to typePriority(), and typePriority(false)

      <title>Bounded sub-selection within an Annotation Index</title>
      
      <para>When selecting Annotations, frequently you may want to select only those which have
      a relation to a bounding Annotation.  A commonly done selection is to select all Annotations 
      (of a particular type) within the span of another, bounding Annotation, such as all <code>Tokens</code>
      within a <code>Sentence</code>.</para>

      and possibly, which Annotations within those bounds would be filtered out.  There are many variations
      possible; these are described in the next section.</para>
