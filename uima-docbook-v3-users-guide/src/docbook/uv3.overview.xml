  <title>Overview of UIMA Version 3</title>
  <titleabbrev>Overview</titleabbrev>
  
  <para>UIMA Version 3 adds significant new functionality for the Java SDK, while remaining 
  backward compatible with Version 2.  Much of this new function is enabled by a shift in the 
  internal details of how Feature Structures are represented.  In Version 3, these are represented
  internally as ordinary Java objects, and subject to garbage collection.</para>
  <blockquote><para>
	  In contrast, version 2 stored Feature Structure data in special internal
	  arrays of <code>ints</code> and other data types.  
	  Any Java object representation of Feature Structures in version 2
	  was merely forwarding references to these internal data representations.
  </para>
  </blockquote>    
  
  <para>If JCas is being used in an application, the JCas classes must be migrated, but this can often
  be done automatically.  In Version 3, the JCas classes ending in "_Type" are no longer used, and the 
  main JCas class definitions are much simplified.</para>
  
  <blockquote><para>
  If an application doesn't use JCas classes, then nothing need be done for migration.
  Otherwise, the JCas classes can be migrated in several ways:

      <listitem>
        <para>If the project is built by Maven, it's possible the JCas classes are built from the type descriptions, 
          using UIMA's
          Maven JCasGen plugin.  If so, you can just rebuild the project; the JCasGen plugin for V3 generates
          the new JCas classes.

      <listitem>
        <para>This is the recommended way if you can't regenerate the classes from the type descriptions.</para>
	      
	      <para>This does the work of migrating and produces new versions of the JCas classes, which
	      need to replace the existing ones.  It allows complex existing JCas classes to migrated, perhaps
	      with developer assistance as needed.  Once done, the application has no migration startup cost.</para>
	      
	      <para>The migration tool is capable of using existing source or compiled JCas classes as input, and 
	      can migrate classes contained within Jars or PEARs.

      <term><emphasis role="strong">regenerating the JCas classes using the JCasGen tool</emphasis></term>
      <listitem><para>The JCasGen tool (available as a Eclipse or Maven plugin, or a stand-alone application) 
      generates Version 3 JCas classes from the XML descriptors.</para>
      
      <para>This is perfectly adequate for migrating non-customized JCas classes.  When run from the
      UIMA Eclipse plugin for editing XML component descriptors, it will attempt to merge customizations
      with generated code.  However, its approach is not as comprehensive as the migration tool, which parses
      the Java source code.</para></listitem>

  <para>Migration of JCas classes is the first step needed to start using UIMA version 3.

            A new <emphasis>select framework</emphasis> provides a concise way to work with Feature Structure
            data stored in the CAS or other collections.  It is integrated with the Java 8 <emphasis>stream</emphasis>
            framework, while providing additional capabilities supported by UIMA, such as the ability to move
            both forwards and backwards while iterating, moving to specific positions, and doing various kinds
            of specialized Annotation selection such as working with Annotations spanned by another annotation.

        <listitem>
          <para>The index and iteration mechanisms are improved; it is now allowed to modify the indexes while
          iterating over them (the iteration will be unaffected by the modification).</para>
          
          <para>Note that the automatic index corruption avoidance introduced in more recent versions of UIMA could
          be automatically removing Feature Structures from indexes and adding them back, if the user was updating
          some Feature of a Feature Structure that was part of an index specification for inclusion or ordering purposes.</para>
          <blockquote><para>In version 2, you would accomplish this using a two pass scheme:
          Pass 1 would iterate and merely collect the Feature Structures to be updated into a Java collection of some kind.
          Pass 2 would use a plain Java iterator over that collection and modify the Feature Structures and/or the UIMA indexes.
          This is no longer needed in version 3; UIMA iterators use a copy-on-write technique to allow index updating,
          while doing whatever minimal copying is needed to continue iteration over the original index.</para>

          with  recent trends in computer hardware 
          over the last 10-15 years.  In particular, space and time tradeoffs are adjusted in favor of
          using more memory for better locality-of-reference, which improves performance.
          In addition, the many internal algorithms (such as managing Feature Structure indexes) have
          been improved.

        <term><emphasis role="strong">New facility: unique IDs for selected Feature Structures</emphasis></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>User defined Types can have use a special, reserved feature name, uimaOID, to store 
          a unique ID which is generated by UIMA.  To enable this for a type, the user defines the
          uimaOID feature; if present, UIMA will assign a
          unique (for this CAS) OID to this feature when creating the Feature Structure.
          This OID is composed of an incrementing number prefixed by the CAS's OID prefix. 
          </para>
          <para>When UIMA sends a CAS to a remote service, it generates an incremented prefix OID that is
          unique for this CAS and sends that along with the CAS; this prefix OID is used by the remote
          service when it needs to generate a unique OID.
          </para>
          
          <para>A new CAS API allows retrieving indexed Feature Structures using this OID.  This capability
          is built lazily on first use, as a special hash table mapping these ids to Feature Structures.  Note that
          this table is built using Java WeakReferences and therefore will not block garbage collecting those
          Feature Structures which are subsequently removed from the index and have no other references to them.

        <term><emphasis role="strong">Integration with Java 8</emphasis></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Version 3 requires Java 8 as the minimum level.  Some of version 3's new facilities, such as the 
          <code>select</code> framework for accessing Feature Structures from CASs or other collections, 
          integrate with the new Java 8 language constructs, such as <code>Streams</code> and <code>Spliterators</code>.</para>

      </varlistentry>

	  </variablelist>
  </para>
  
  <para>Just to give a small taste of the kinds of things Java 8 integration provides, 
  here's an example of using the new <code>select</code> framework, where the task is to compute
  <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
  <listitem><para>a Set of all the found types
  <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
  <listitem><para>in a UIMA index</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>under some top-most type "MyType"</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>occurring as Annotations within a particular bounding Annotation</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>that are nonOverlapping</para></listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  </para></listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  </para>
  
  <para>
  Here is the Java code using the new <code>select</code> framework together with Java 8 streaming functions:
  
  <informalexample>  <?dbfo keep-together="always"?>
<programlisting>Set&lt;Type&gt; foundTypes =
   myIndex.select(MyType.class) 
   .coveredBy(myBoundingAnnotation)
   .nonOverlapping()
   .map(fs -> fs.getType())
   .collect(Collectors.toCollection(TreeSet::new));
</programlisting>
</informalexample>
</para>

<para>
Another example: to collect, by category, the average length of the annotations having that category.
Here we assume that <code>MyType</code> is an <code>Annotation</code> and that it has
a feature called <code>category</code> which returns a String denoting the category:
<informalexample>  <?dbfo keep-together="always"?>
<programlisting>Map&lt;String, Double&gt; freqByCategory =
   myIndex.select(MyType.class)
   .collect(Collectors
     .groupingBy(MyType::getCategory,
                 Collectors.averagingDouble(f -> 
                   (double)(f.getEnd() - f.getBegin()))));
