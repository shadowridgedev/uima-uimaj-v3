<h2><a name="what.is.uima">1. What is UIMA?</a></h2>

     <p>
  			Unstructured Information Management applications are
				software systems that analyze large volumes of
				unstructured information in order to discover knowledge
				that is relevant to an end user. UIMA is a framework and
				SDK for developing such applications. An example UIM
				application might ingest plain text and identify
				entities, such as persons, places, organizations; or
				relations, such as works-for or located-at. UIMA enables
				such an application to be decomposed into components,
				for example "language identification" -&gt; "language
				specific segmentation" -&gt; "sentence boundary
				detection" -&gt; "entity detection (person/place names
				etc.)". Each component must implement interfaces defined
				by the framework and must provide self-describing
				metadata via XML descriptor files. The framework manages
				these components and the data flow between them.
				Components are written in Java or C++; the data that
				flows between components is designed for efficient
				mapping between these languages. UIMA additionally
				provides capabilities to wrap components as network
				services, and can scale to very large volumes by
				replicating processing pipelines over a cluster of
				networked nodes.
			</p>
      <p>
				Apache UIMA is an Apache-licensed open source
				implementation of the UIMA specification (that
				specification is, in turn, being developed concurrently
				by a technical committee within
				<a href="http://www.oasis-open.org">OASIS</a>,
				a standards organization). We invite and encourage you
				to participate in both the implementation and
				specification efforts.
			</p>
      <p>
				UIMA is a component framework for analysing unstructured
				content such as text, audio and video. It comprises an
				SDK and tooling for composing and running analytic
				components written in Java and C++, with some support
				for Perl, Python and TCL.
			</p>

<h2><a name="major.changes">Major Changes in this Release</a></h2>
<p>
The meaning of "bag" and "sorted" index has been made consistent with how these are handled
when sending CASes to remote services.  This means that adding the same identical FS to the
indexes, multiple times, will not add duplicate index entries.  And, removing a FS from an index
is guaranteed that that particular FS will no longer be in any index.  (Before, if you had 
added a particular FS to a sorted or bag index, multiple times, the remove behavior would
remove just one of the instances).  Deserialization of CASes sent to remote services has never 
added Feature Structures to the index multiple times, so this change makes that behavior 
consistent. For more details, see <a target="_blank" href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/UIMA-3399">
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/UIMA-3399</a>.
</p>

<p>Because some users may prefer the previous behavior that permitted duplicates of identical Feature Structures in
the sorted and bag indexes. this change can be disabled, by running the JVM with the defined property
"uima.allow_duplicate_add_to_indices".</p>

<p>
 JSON serialization support is added for Type System Descriptions, and for CASs.
  Several formats for JSON CAS serialization are provided, please see the chapter in the
  UIMA reference documentation for details.
</p>

<p>There is a new kind of check that may be optionally enabled in UIMA (by defining the JVM argument
  "-Duima.uima.check_fs_update_corrupts_index") that checks all modifications to features to see if that feature is
  being used as a key in a Sort or Set index, and the Feature Structure being modified is currently in
  one or more indices (Jira issue UIMA-4059). Doing such a modification can cause the index to become corrupt.  
  (The correct way   to do an update in this case is to 
    first remove the Feature Structure from the indices, 
    do the modification,
    and then add it back to the indices.)</p>

<p>Java 7 is now the minimum level of Java required.</p>

<p>The fixed bugs include fixes to the UIMA iterator moveTo(FeatureStructure) and creation methods which 
ended up doing a moveToFirst() if the Feature Structure was beyond the last element in the index;
the fixed code now marks the position of the iterator as invalid.  Also, the positioning of these
when there were many FSs that compared "equal" didn't always pick the "leftmost" one - that has been fixed, too.</p>

<p>See the README file for information on special backwards compatible flags.
