/**
 * Feature structure index access interface.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Notice that each feature structure index uses its own ordering relation that will usually be
 * different from index to index. In particular, equality with respect to the index ordering will in
 * general not imply object identity for the feature structures.
 * 
 * <p>
 * We currently support three different kinds of indexes: sorted, set and bag indexes. The default
 * index is a sorted index. In a sorted index, FSs that are committed (added to the indexes) 
 * are added, unless they are duplicates of already existing FSs in the index.  
 * Multiple different instances of FSs which compare equal may all be in the index, individually.
 * 
 * <p>  
 * The index is sorted in the sense that iterators will
 * output FSs in sorted order according to the comparator for that index. The order of FSs that are
 * equal with respect to the comparator is arbitrary but fixed. That is, if you iterate over the same index
 * several times, you will see the same relative order of FSs every time. We also guarantee that
 * reverse iterators will produce exactly the reverse sequence of forward iteration.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A set index will contain no duplicates of the same type, where a duplicate is defined by the
 * indexing comparator. That is, if you commit two feature structures of the same type that are
 * equal with respect to the indexing comparator, only the first one will be entered into the index. Note that
 * you can still have duplicates with respect to the indexing order if they are of a different type;
 * different types are never "equal". A set index is not in any particular sort order.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A bag index finally simply stores everything, without any guaranteed order. 
 * Operations that depend on comparison, such as find(FeatureStructure fs) or
 * FSIterator.moveTo(FeatureStructure fs) only compare for equality using FeatureStructure identity,
 * since no ordering relationship is possible with bag indexes.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Indexes have a top-most type; let's call it T.  They store only instances of that type or its subtypes.
 * A given index definition specifies this top-most type.  The APIs for obtaining an index
 * include the ability to specify, in addition, a type T2 which is a subtype of T; indexes obtained 
 * using this will have only instances of type T2 or its subtypes.
 * 
 * @param T the topmost type in this Index
