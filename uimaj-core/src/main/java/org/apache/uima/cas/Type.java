 * The interface describing types in the type system.

 * <p>
 * <a name="names">Type names</a> are Java strings that look like Java class names. For example,
 * the built-in annotation type is called <code>uima.tcas.Annotation</code>. The whole string is
 * called the (fully) qualified type name. The part after the last period is called the short or
 * base name. The rest of the name is the name space of the type. This part can be empty, in which
 * case the qualified and the base name are identical.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <a name="identifiers">Type system identifiers</a> in general have the following syntax: they are
 * non-empty strings whose first character is a letter (Unicode letter), followed by an arbitrary
 * sequence of letters, digits and underscores. No other characters are legal parts of identifiers.
 * A type name is then a non-empty sequence of identifiers separated by periods. See also <a
 * href="./Feature.html#names">Feature names</a>.
