/**
 * An annotation index provides additional iterator functionality that applies only to instances of
 * <code>uima.tcas.Annotation</code>. You can obtain an AnnotationIndex by calling:
 * <p>
 * <code>AnnotationIndex idx = (AnnotationIndex)cas.getAnnotationIndex();</code> <br>(the
 * typecast is necessary for historical reasons).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that the AnnotationIndex defines the following sort order between two annotations:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Annotations are sorted in increasing order of their start offset. That is, for any
 * annotations a and b, if <code>a.start &lt; b.start</code> then <code> a &lt; b</code>.</li>
 * <li>Annotations whose start offsets are equal are next sorted by <i>decreasing</i> order of
 * their end offsets. That is, if <code>a.start = b.start</code> and <code>a.end &gt; b.end</code>,
 * then <code> a &lt; b</code>. This causes annotations with larger spans to be sorted before
 * annotations with smaller spans, which produces an iteration order similar to a preorder tree
 * traversal.</li>
 * <li>Annotations whose start offsets are equal and whose end offsets are equal are sorted based
 * on {@link org.apache.uima.resource.metadata.TypePriorities} (which is an element of the component
 * descriptor). That is, if <code>a.start = b.start</code>, <code>a.end = b.end</code>, and
 * the type of <code>a</code> is defined before the type of <code>b</code> in the type
 * priorities, then <code>a &lt; b</code>.
 * <li>
 * <li>If none of the above rules apply, then the ordering is arbitrary. This will occur if you
 * have two annotations of the exact same type that also have the same span. It will also occur if
 * you have not defined any type priority between two annotations that have the same span.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * In the method descriptions below, the notation <code>a &lt; b</code>, where <code>a</code>
 * and <code>b</code> are annotations, should be taken to mean <code>a</code> comes before
 * <code>b</code> in the index, according to the above rules.
