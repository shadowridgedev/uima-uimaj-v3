/**
 * Iterator over feature structures.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This iterator interface extends {@link java.util.Iterator}, and supports the
 * standard <code>hasNext</code> and <code>next</code> methods. If finer control, including
 * reverse iteration, is needed, see below.
 * 
 * <p>Note: do not use the APIs described below *together* with the standard Java iterator methods
 * <code>next()</code> and <code>hasNext()</code>.  On any given iterator, use either the one or the
 * other, but not both together.  Otherwise, <code>next/hasNext</code> may exhibit incorrect
 * behavior.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The <code>FSIterator</code> interface introduces the methods {@link #get()},
 * {@link #moveToNext()}, {@link #moveToPrevious()} methods. With these methods, retrieving the
 * current element (<code>get</code>) is a separate operation from moving the iterator (<code>moveToNext</code>
 * and <code>moveToPrevious</code>. This makes the user's code less compact, but allows for finer
 * control.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Specifically the <code>get</code> method is defined to return the same element that a call to
 * <code>next()</code> would return, but does not advance the iterator.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface are not required to be fail-fast. That is, if the iterator's
 * collection is modified, the effects on the iterator are in general undefined. Some collections
 * may handle this more gracefully than others, but in general, concurrent modification of the
 * collection you're iterating over is a bad idea.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If the iterator is moved past the boundaries of the collection, the behavior of subsequent calls
 * to {@link FSIterator#moveToNext() moveToNext()} or
 * {@link FSIterator#moveToPrevious() moveToPrevious()} is undefined. For example, if a previously
 * valid iterator is invalidated by a call to {@link FSIterator#moveToNext() moveToNext()}, a
 * subsequent call to {@link FSIterator#moveToPrevious() moveToPrevious()} is not guaranteed to set
 * the iterator back to the last element in the collection. Always use
 * {@link FSIterator#moveToLast() moveToLast()} in such cases.
 *
