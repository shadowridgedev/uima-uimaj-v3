/**
 * Version 3 (2016, for Java 8) of map between id's (ints) JCasCover Objects
 * 
 * Note: in the general case, the cover object may *not* be a JCas one, but rather the general one
 *       This happens if there is no JCas cover object defined for the type.
 * 
 * Assumptions:  Each addr has a corresponding JCas; 
 * it is permitted to "update" an addr with a different JCas
 * cover class (use case: low level APIs changing the type of an object)
 * 
 * Table always a power of 2 in size - permits faster hashing
 * 
 * Accesses to this table are threadsafe, in order to support
 * read-only CASes being shared by multiple threads. 
 * Multiple iterators in different threads could be accessing the map and updating it.
 * 
 * Load factor tuning. 2,000,000 random inserts, 50 reps (for JIT)
 *   .5 (2x to 4x entries)  99%  5 probes   250 ms
 *   .6 (1.67 to 3.3)       99%  6 probes   285 ms
 *   .7 (1.43 to 2.86)      99%  8 probes   318 ms 
 *   .8 (1.25 to 2.5)       99%  11 probes  360 ms
 *   
 *    version 1 at load factor .5 ran about 570 ms * 1.x 
 *      (did 2 lookups for fetches if not found,) 
 *
 * Has standard get method plus a 
 * putIfAbsent method, which if not absent, returns the value gotten.
 *   Value is a IntSupplier, not invoked unless absent.
 * 
 * Locking:
 *   get calls which find the element operate without locking.
 *   
 *   There is one lock used for reading and updating the table
 *     -- not used for reading when item found, only if item not found  
 * 
 * Strategy: have 1 outer implementation delegating to multiple inner ones
 *   number = concurrency level (a power of 2)
 *   
 *   The hash uses some # of low order bits to address the right inner one.
 *   
 *  This table is used to hold JCas cover classes for CAS feature structures.  
 *  There are potentially multiple instances of this table associated with each CAS that is using it,
 *    when PEARs are involved.
 * <p> 
 * The creation of the new JCas cover object can, in turn, run arbitrary user code, 
 * which can result in updates to the JCasHashMap which occur before this original update occurs.
 * <p>
 * In a multi-threaded environment, multiple threads can do a "get" 
 * for the same Feature Structure instance.  If it's not in the Map, the correct behavior is:
 * <p>
 * one of the threads adds the new element
 * the other threads wait for the one thread to finish adding, and then return the object that the one thread added.
 * <p>
 * The implementation works as follows:
 * <p>
 * 1) The JCasHashMap is split into "n" sub-maps.   
 *    The number is the number of cores, but grows more slowly as the # of cores &gt; 16. 
 *    This number can be specified, but this is not currently exposed in the tuning parameters
 *    Locking occurs on the sub-maps; the outer method calls are not synchronized
 * 2) The number of sub maps is rounded to a power of 2, to allow the low order bits of the hash of the key 
 *     to be used to pick the map (via masking).
 * 3) a put:
 *    3a) locks
 *    3b) does a find; if found, updates that, if not, adds new value
 *    3c) unlocks
 * 4) a putIfAbsent:
 *    4a) does a find (not under lock)
 *        - if found returns that (not under lock)
 *        - note: this has a race condition if another thread is updating / changing that slot
 *          -- this only happens for unsupported conditions, so is not checked
 *            -- changing the type of an existing FS while another thread is accessing the CAS
 *    4b) if not found, locks
 *    4c) does find again
 *    4d) if found, return that and release lock
 *    4e) if not found, eval the creator form and use to set the value, and release lock
 *    
 *  Note: if eval of creator form recursively calls this, that's OK because sync locks can
 *  be recursively gotten and released in a nested way.
 *       
 * 5) get does a find, if found, returns that.
 *   - if not, get lock, redo search 
 *     -- if not resized, start find from last spot. else start from beginning.
 *   - if found, return that (release lock). if not found return null (release lock)
 *     
 * <p>
 * Supports 
 *   put(pre-computed-value), 
 *   putIfAbsent(value-to-be-computed, as an IntSupplier)
 *   get
