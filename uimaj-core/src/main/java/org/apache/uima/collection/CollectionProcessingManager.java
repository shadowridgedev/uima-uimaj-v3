/**
 * A <code>CollectionProcessingManager</code> (CPM) manages the application of an
 * {@link AnalysisEngine} to a collection of artifacts. For text analysis applications, this will be
 * a collection of documents. The analysis results will then be delivered to one ore more
 * {@link CasConsumer}s.
 * <p>
 * The CPM is configured with an Analysis Engine and CAS Consumers by calling its
 * {@link #setAnalysisEngine(AnalysisEngine)} and {@link #addCasConsumer(CasConsumer)} methods.
 * Collection processing is then initiated by calling the {@link #process(CollectionReader)} or
 * {@link #process(CollectionReader,int)} methods.
 * <p>
 * The <code>process</code> methods take a {@link CollectionReader} object as an argument. The
 * Collection Reader retrieves each artifact from the collection as a
 * {@link org.apache.uima.cas.CAS} object.
 * <p>
 * Listeners can register with the CPM by calling the
 * {@link #addStatusCallbackListener(StatusCallbackListener)} method. These listeners receive status
 * callbacks during the processing. At any time, performance and progress reports are available from
 * the {@link #getPerformanceReport()} and {@link #getProgress()} methods.
 * <p>
 * A CPM implementation may choose to implement parallelization of the processing, but this is not a
 * requirement of the architecture.
 * <p>
 * Note that a CPM only supports processing one collection at a time. Attempting to reconfigure a
 * CPM or start a new processing job while a previous processing job is occurring will result in a
 * {@link org.apache.uima.UIMA_IllegalStateException}. Processing multiple collections
 * simultaneously is done by instantiating and configuring multiple instances of the CPM.
 * <p>
 * A <code>CollectionProcessingManager</code> instance can be obtained by calling
 * {@link org.apache.uima.UIMAFramework#newCollectionProcessingManager()}.
