/**
 * Any component that operates on analysis results produced by a UIMA CasDataProcessor.

 * {@link org.apache.uima.collection.CollectionProcessingManager} (CPM). During collection
 * processing, the CPM will pass each CasData from CasProcessor to each consumer's process method.
 * The CAS consumer can do anything it wants with the CASes it receives; commonly CAS consumers will
 * build aggregate data structures such as search engine indices or glossaries.
 * <p>
 * The CPM will also call each CAS Consumer's {@link #batchProcessComplete(ProcessTrace)} method at
 * the end of each batch and their {@link #collectionProcessComplete(ProcessTrace)} method called at
 * the end of the collection.
