/**
 * The Base CPM interface is a lower-level interface to the Collection Processing Manager. It is
 * recommended that developers use the {@link org.apache.uima.collection.CollectionProcessingEngine}
 * and {@link org.apache.uima.collection.metadata.CpeDescription} interfaces instead.
 * <p>
 * The CPM is configured with a list of {@link CasProcessor}s by calling its
 * {@link #addCasProcessor(CasProcessor)} method. A single {@link BaseCollectionReader} must be
 * provided, via the {@link #setCollectionReader(BaseCollectionReader)} method. Collection
 * processing is then initiated by calling the {@link #process()} method.
 * <p>
 * Listeners can register with the CPM by calling the
 * {@link #addStatusCallbackListener(BaseStatusCallbackListener)} method. These listeners receive
 * status callbacks during the processing. At any time, performance and progress reports are
 * available from the {@link #getPerformanceReport()} and {@link #getProgress()} methods.
 * <p>
 * A CPM implementation may choose to implement parallelization of the processing, but this is not a
 * requirement of the architecture.
 * <p>
 * Note that a CPM only supports processing one collection at a time. Attempting to reconfigure a
 * CPM or start a new processing job while a previous processing job is occurring will result in a
 * {@link org.apache.uima.UIMA_IllegalStateException}. Processing multiple collections
 * simultaneously is done by instantiating and configuring multiple instances of the CPM.
