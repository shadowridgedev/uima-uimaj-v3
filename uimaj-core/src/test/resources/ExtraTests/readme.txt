This folder has extra tests, mostly from users posting zip files to Jiras.
Each test has a folder, containing the test (a zip file or other) and a readme identifying 
  - the source ( e.g. a Jira)
  - what it's testing (if needed - sometimes the Jira has that)
  
Naming: either a jira or a keyword saying what's being tested
