 * Workarounds for JFileChooser bugs on Windows Look and Feel.

 * http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4711700</a>), Call {@link #fix()} after
 * setting Windows look and feel but before creating any file choosers.
 * <p>
 * To workaround intermittent exceptions thrown by JFileChooser.setCurrentDirectory() when it is
 * called during initialization of your app, call the
 * {@link #setCurrentDirectory(JFileChooser, File)} method on this class rather than using the
 * JFileChooser directly. This will use SwingUtilities.invokeLater to put the request on the event
 * thread so it will not be executed until the event thread starts, thus avoiding the race condition
 * hat otherwise occurs.
