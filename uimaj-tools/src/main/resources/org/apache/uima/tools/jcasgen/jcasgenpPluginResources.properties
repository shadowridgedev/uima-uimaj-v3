pluginName = UIMA JCas generate from XML
providerName = org.apache.uima

ReadingDescriptorAndCreatingTypes = Reading the XML TAE descriptor, and creating types, for xml input file ''{0}''.
fileNotFound = Input file: ''{0}'' not found.
sourceArgNeedsDirectory = 1st argument, ''{0}'' needs to include a directory, or a second argument must be used to specify the output directory.
updatingTarget = Merging: ''{0}''.
replacingTarget = Replacing: ''{0}''.
creatingTarget = Creating: ''{0}''.
missingArguments = Argument(s) missing - Requires at least 1 argument - the xml source.
fileDoesntParse = File ''{0}'' doesn''t have an AnalysisEngine Descriptor or a TypeSystem Descriptor, which are the required kinds of input.
typesHaveFeaturesAdded = Warning: the following types were generated by merging different type descriptors, where the resulting number of features is larger than that of the components. Although the resulting generated JCas classes are correct, doing this kind of merging makes reuse of this component more difficult.{0}
reservedNameUsed = The feature name ''{0}'', specified in Type ''{1}'' is reserved. Please choose another name.
invalidXML = Invalid XML found in input file ''{0}''.
resourceInitializationException = ****** Resource Initialization Error occurred while instantiating the CAS type system. Continuing, but may generate incorrectly.  Caused by ''{0}''.******
IOException = Input/Output exception occurred.
pkgMissing = The CAS Type ''{0}'' is missing a namespace qualifier. JCas generated classes will be in the default Java package.
nullPtr = Null Pointer exception: Insure the CAS type name is qualified by having a required namespace, for type ''{0}''.
InstantiationException = Unexpected InstantiationException
IllegalAccessException = Unexpected IllegalAccessException
limitingButTypeWasExtended = JCasGen being run in mode to limit generation to locally defined types, but type ''{0}'' from sources {1} was merged.  The generation operation is stopped.
