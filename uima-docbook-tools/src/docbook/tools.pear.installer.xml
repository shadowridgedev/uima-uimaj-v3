  <title>PEAR Installer User&apos;s Guide</title>
  
  <para>PEAR (Processing Engine ARchive) is a new standard for packaging UIMA compliant
    components. This standard defines several service elements that should be included in
    the archive package to enable automated installation of the encapsulated UIMA
    component. The major PEAR service element is an XML Installation Descriptor that
    specifies installation platform, component attributes, custom installation
    procedures and environment variables. </para>
  
  <para>The installation of a UIMA compliant component includes 2 steps: (1) installation of
    the component code and resources in a local file system, and (2) verification of the
    serviceability of the installed component. Installation of the component code and
    resources involves extracting component files from the archive (PEAR) package in a
    designated directory and localizing file references in component descriptors and other
    configuration files. Verification of the component serviceability is accomplished
    with the help of standard UIMA mechanisms for instantiating analysis engines.

  <para>There are two versions of the PEAR Installer.  One is an interactive, GUI-based
  application which puts up a panel asking for the parameters of the installation; the 
  other is a command line interface version where you pass the parameters needed on the command
  line itself.  To launch the GUI version of the PEAR Installer, use the script in the UIMA bin directory: 
  <code>runPearInstaller.bat</code> or <code>runPearInstaller.sh.</code>
  The command line is launched using <code>runPearInstallerCli.cmd</code> or 
  <code>runPearInstallerCli.sh.</code></para>
  
  <para>The PEAR Installer installs UIMA
    compliant components (analysis engines) from PEAR packages in a local file system. To
    install a desired UIMA component the user needs to select the appropriate PEAR file in a
    local file system and specify the installation directory (optional). If no installation
    directory is specified, the PEAR file is installed to the current working directory. 
	By default the PEAR packages are not installed directly to the specified installation directory. 
	For each PEAR a subdirectory with the name of the PEAR's ID is created where the PEAR package is 
	installed to. If the PEAR installation directory already exists, the old content is automatically 
	deleted before the new content is installed. During the
    component installation the user can read messages printed by the installation program in
    the message area of the application window. If the installation fails, appropriate error
    message is printed to help identifying and fixing the problem.</para>
  
  <para>After the desired UIMA component is successfully installed, the PEAR Installer
    allows testing this component in the CAS Visual Debugger (CVD) application, which is
    provided with the UIMA package. The CVD application will load your UIMA component using
    its XML descriptor file. If the component is loaded successfully, you&apos;ll be able to
    run it either with sample documents provided in the
    <literal>&lt;UIMA_HOME&gt;/examples/data</literal> directory, or with any other
    sample documents. See <olink targetdoc="&uima_docs_tools;"
      targetptr="ugr.tools.cvd"/> for more information about the CVD application.
    Running your component in the CVD application helps to make sure the component will run in
    other UIMA applications. If the CVD application fails to load or run your component, or
    throws an exception, you can find more information about the problem in the uima.log file
    in the current working directory. The log file can be viewed with the CVD.</para>
  
  <para>PEAR Installer creates a file named <literal>setenv.txt</literal> in the
    <literal>&lt;component_root&gt;/metadata</literal> directory. This file contains
    environment variables required to run your component in any UIMA application. 
    It also creates a PEAR descriptor (see also <olink targetdoc="&uima_docs_ref;"
      targetptr="ugr.ref.pear.specifier"/>)
    file named <literal>&lt;componentID&gt;_pear.xml</literal> 
    in the <literal>&lt;component_root&gt;</literal> directory that can be used to directly run
    the installed pear file in your application.
  </para>

  <para>
    The metadata/setenv.txt is not read by the UIMA framework anywhere.  
    It's there for use by non-UIMA application code if that code wants to set environment variables.
    The metadata/setenv.txt is just a "convenience" file duplicating what's in the xml.  
  </para>
  
  <para>
    The setenv.txt file has 2 special variables: the CLASSPATH and the PATH. 
    The CLASSPATH is computed from any supplied CLASSPATH environment variable, 
    plus the jars that are configured in the PEAR structure, including subcomponents. 
    The PATH is similarly computed, using any supplied PATH environment variable plus 
    it includes the "bin" subdirectory of the PEAR structure, if it exists.
  </para>
  
  <para>The command line version of the PEAR installer has one required argument:
  the path to the PEAR file being installed.  A second argument can specify the
  installation directory (default is the current working directory).
  An optional argument, one of "-c" or "-check" or "-verify", causes verification to be done
  after installation, as described above.</para>
