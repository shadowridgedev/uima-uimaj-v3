To build Apache UIMA Java SDK, 
  cd to the uimaj directory - the one containing the pom.xml having the element 
    <artifactId>uimaj</artifactId>, and then run the command

  mvn install
  
This will build all the submodules including the binary distribution package.

Apache Maven 3.0 or later is required to build this.
