1. What is UIMA?

Unstructured Information Management applications are software systems that 
analyze large volumes of unstructured information in order to discover knowledge
that is relevant to an end user. UIMA is a framework and SDK for developing such
applications. An example UIM application might ingest plain text and identify 
entities, such as persons, places, organizations; or relations, such as 
works-for or located-at. UIMA enables such an application to be decomposed into 
components, for example "language identification" -> 
"language specific segmentation" -> "sentence boundary detection" -> 
"entity detection (person/place names etc.)". Each component must implement 
interfaces defined by the framework and must provide self-describing metadata 
via XML descriptor files. The framework manages these components and the data 
flow between them. Components are written in Java or C++; the data that 
flows between components is designed for efficient mapping between these 
languages. UIMA additionally provides capabilities to wrap components as 
network services, and can scale to very large volumes by replicating processing 
pipelines over a cluster of networked nodes.

Apache UIMA is an Apache-licensed open source implementation of the UIMA 
specification (that specification is, in turn, being developed concurrently by 
a technical committee within OASIS , a standards organization). We invite and 
encourage you to participate in both the implementation and specification 
efforts.

UIMA is a component framework for analysing unstructured content such as text, 
audio and video. It comprises an SDK and tooling for composing and running 
analytic components written in Java and C++, with some support for Perl, 
Python and TCL.


2. Major Changes in this Release

Please see the README for this information.  

3. Migrating from IBM UIMA to Apache UIMA

This section describes how to move from pre-Apache versions of UIMA to the
Apache version (starting with Apache UIMA 2.1).

Note: Before running the migration utility, be sure to back up your files, just 
in case you encounter any problems, because the migration tool updates the 
files in place in the directories where it finds them.

The migration utility is run by executing the script file 
apache-uima/bin/ibmUimaToApacheUima.bat (Windows) or 
apache-uima/bin/ibmUimaToApacheUima.sh (UNIX). You must pass one argument: the 
directory containing the files that you want to be migrated. Subdirectories 
will be processed recursively.

The script scans your files and applies the necessary updates, for example 
replacing the com.ibm package names with the new org.apache package names. 

The script will only attempt to modify files with the extensions: java, xml, 
xmi, wsdd, properties, launch, bat, cmd, sh, ksh, or csh; and files with no 
extension. Also, files with size greater than 1,000,000 bytes will be skipped. 
(If you want the script to modify files with other extensions, you can edit 
the script file and change the -ext argument appropriately.)

If the migration tool reports warnings, there may be a few additional steps to 
take. The following two sections explain some simple manual changes that you
might need to make to your code.

3.1. JCas Cover Classes for DocumentAnnotation

If you have run JCasGen it is likely that you have the classes 
com.ibm.uima.jcas.tcas.DocumentAnnotation and 
com.ibm.uima.jcas.tcas.DocumentAnnotation_Type as part of your code. This 
package name is no longer valid, and the migration utility does not move your 
files between directories so it is unable to fix this.

If you have not made manual modifications to these classes, the best solution 
is usually to just delete these two classes (and their containing package). 
There is a default version in the uima-document-annotation.jar file that is 
included in Apache UIMA. If you have made custom changes, then you should not 
delete the file but instead move it to the correct package 
org.apache.uima.jcas.tcas. For more information about JCas and 
DocumentAnnotation please see Section 5.5.4, 
"Adding Features to DocumentAnnotation" in the UIMA References manual
(docs/html/references/references.html).

3.2. JCas.getDocumentAnnotation

The deprecated method JCas.getDocumentAnnotation has been removed. Its use 
must be replaced with JCas.getDocumentAnnotationFs. The method 
JCas.getDocumentAnnotationFs() returns type TOP, so your code must cast this to 
type DocumentAnnotation. The reasons for this are described in Section 
5.5.4, "Adding Features to DocumentAnnotation" in the UIMA References manual
(docs/html/references/references.html).

3.3. Rare Cases Where Additional Manual Migration is Necessary

For most users there should not be any additional migration steps necessary.
However, if the migration tool reported an additional warning or if you are 
having trouble getting your code to compile or run after running the migration, 
please see Section 1.4.2. "Rare Cases Where Additional Manual Migration is 
Necessary," in the Overview and Setup manual 
(docs/html/overview_and_setup/overview_and_setup.html).


4. How to Get Involved

The Apache UIMA project really needs and appreciates any contributions, 
including documentation help, source code and feedback.  If you are interested
in contributing, please visit http://uima.apache.org/get-involved.html.


5. How to Report Issues

The Apache UIMA project uses JIRA for issue tracking.  Please report any 
issues you find at http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/uima.
