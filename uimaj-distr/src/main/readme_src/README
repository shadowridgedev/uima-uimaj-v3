NOTE: This file is no longer used (as of 10/2010) - how to build is
now merged with the top level README file.

To build from the source distribution, you'll need a Java 1.5 or later.  We've
tested with Sun Java and IBM Java.  Then,

a) download and install Maven, release 3 (from http://maven.apache.org)
b) set the environment variable MAVEN_OPTS to 
   -Xmx800m  -XX:MaxPermSize=256m
b) cd to uimaj-distr directory in this unzipped archive
c) run the maven command "mvn install"

This should build things and install them to your local maven
repository, and also build the distribution packages in the 
uimaj-distr/target directory.

For more in depth instructions on building Apache UIMA please refer to:
http://uima.apache.org/building-uima.html . 

(Optional) You can run the tool packageAllJavaSourcesIntoJar.bat (or .sh) 
to package all of the java sources into a compressed Jar which can then
be used with IDEs such as Eclipse to enable those tools to have access to
the sources.  For the Eclipse IDE, for example, when it steps in 
debug mode into a class where it doesn't know about the sources,
it asks you to attach the sources - you can simply attach the
generated all-sources Jar, and it will work.

Note: this tool requires that Apache Ant be installed; you can set
ANT_HOME environment variable to specify the particular version,
if it isn't already in the Path.

For Eclipse, there is a launch configuration you can run (if you
have checked out the uima projects into a common workspace)
called "UIMA packageAllJavaSourcesIntoJar".

Alternatively, if you have installed both the Apache UIMA 
binary distribution and the
Apache UIMA source distribution, you can run the addSourceJars.bat 
(or .sh) script to add the source code to the jar files in the 
UIMA_HOME/lib directory.  Note that this does not add the sources
for the Eclipse plugins (use the packageAllJavaSourcesIntoJar for 
that).  This may make it more convenient to access
the UIMA Source Code (and JavaDocs) from an IDE such as Eclipse.
