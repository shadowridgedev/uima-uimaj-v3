/**
 * Interface for "Subject of Analysis" (Sofa) feature structures. A Sofa is implemented as a
 * built-in CAS type uima.cas.Sofa. The features of the Sofa type include:
 * <ul>
 * <li>SofaID: Every Sofa in a CAS must have a unique SofaID. SoaIDs are the primary handle or
 * access.
 * <li>Mime type: This string feature can be used to describe the type of the data represented by
 * the Sofa.
 * <li>Sofa Data: The data itself. This data can be resident in the CAS or it can be a reference to
 * data outside the CAS.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * SofaFS (the feature structure that represents a SofA) are created as a side effect of
 * creating a new CAS view.  To create a new CAS view, use 
 * {@link org.apache.uima.cas.CAS#createView CAS.createView(string-view-name)}. 
 * From the returned CAS view, you can get the associated SofaFS instance, using
 * {@link org.apache.uima.cas.CAS#getSofa CAS.getSofa()}.  
 * The SofaFS interface provides methods to set the values of the features of the Sofa FS. Generic CAS APIs
 * should never be used to create Sofas or set their features.
 * <p>
 * Sofa data can be contained locally in the CAS itself or it can be remote from CAS. To set the
 * local Sofa data in the Sofa FS use:
 * {@link org.apache.uima.cas.SofaFS#setLocalSofaData(FeatureStructure) SofaFS.setLocalSofaData()}. If the data is
 * remote from the CAS use:
 * {@link org.apache.uima.cas.SofaFS#setRemoteSofaURI SofaFS.setRemoteSofaURI()}.
 * <p>
 * Once set, the Sofa data cannot be set again until the CAS has been reset. This is so that
 * annotators cannot change the subject of analysis during processing.
