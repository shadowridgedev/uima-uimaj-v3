Some tokenization "test" to do !  We are checking so-so and so - so and

very special.  Single char abrs like John C.  Mills.  This is zyz. but
not known as abbreviation.  This is zyz. BUT not known as abbreviation.
Another case is .  in a sentence???  Or .Net .12 or so.  Numbers 9.23 1,23
$12 22% #2 and so on !!!  Parentheses (which are important) and [numeric]
{expressions} ((*)) like (3 - 5) + 2 * -1 / 12 or 1/2 must work too.
Also mark@twain.com and 9.4.124.8 and
www.ibm-research.com @are also@ ### $$ @@ -checked.  Commas, and semicolons; and colons:
