/**
 * UIMATypeSystemClassLoader is used only to load generated JCas classes, lazily.
 * Multiple instances of these support having multiple type systems in use in one JVM; it is up to the 
 * application setup code to create these class loaders.
 * 
 *   For simple cases, without multiple type systems, if you don't care about lazy instantiation, you can 
 *   have type system commit do a batch generation and load into a specific arbitrary class loader; 
 *   @see {@link UIMATypeSystemClassLoaderInjector}.
 * 
 * For Application, External Resource, and Annotator code to have references to these JCas classes, 
 * that code must be loaded under this ClassLoader (or a child of it). 
 * 
 * This loader has no class path; it is only used for lazy generation and loading of JCas classes
 * 
 * Because the _Type class has static references to the main JCas class, the main JCas class is loaded first.
 * 
 * This loader has a reference to the committed type system, that starts out as null.  Type system commit 
 * sets it.  If it is already set, a second set is an error unless the type systems are the same.
 * 
 * This loader does nothing unless the type system ref is set.  Then it looks up the type being loaded, and if it matches
 * a JCas type, it generates and loads the main and _Type classes. Otherwise, it delegates to its parent.
