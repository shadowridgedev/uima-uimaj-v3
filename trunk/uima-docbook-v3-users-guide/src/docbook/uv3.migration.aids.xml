  <title>Migration aids</title>
    
    <para>To aid migration, some features of UIMA V3 which might cause migration difficulties 
      can be disabled.  Users may initially want to disable these, and get their pipelines working,
      and then over time, re-enable these while fixing any issues that may come up, one feature
      at a time.
    </para> 
    
    <para>
      Global JVM properties for UIMA V3 that control these are described in the table below.

                  <para>When type systems are committed, the resulting Type System (Java object) 
                    is considered read-only, and is compared to already existing Type Systems.
                    Existing type systems, if found, are reused.  Besides saving storage, this can
                    sometimes improve locality of reference, and therefore, performance. 
                    Setting this property disables this consolidation.</para></entry>

                  <para>UIMA has some limited support for typed arrays.  
                    These are declared in type system descriptors by including an 
                    elementType specification for a feature whose range is FSArray.
                    See <olink targetdoc="&uima_docs_ref;" targetptr="ugr.ref.xml.component_descriptor.type_system.features"/>.

                    no element type specification included in the serialized form.
                    The deserialization code, when deserializing these, 
                    looks at the type system's feature declaration to see if it has an elementType, and if so, 
                    changes the type of the Feature Structure to that type.
